### In-App Purchases Process

### Load In-App Identifiers

**Options for storing the list of product identifiers**

After setting up product identifiers in iTunes Connect

Bakes into your app 

`let identifiers = ["com.myComany.myApp.product1,"com.myComany.myApp.product1]`

Or fetch from your sever

`let identifiers = remoteIdentifiers()`

### Fetch Product Info

```Swift
    let request = SKProductsRequest(productIdentifiers: identifierSet)
    request.delegate = self
    request.start()
    
    func productsRequest(_ request: SKProductsRequest, didReceive response: SKProductsResponse) {
    	for product in reponse.products {
    		// Localized title and description
    		product.localizedTitle
    		product.localizedDescription
    		// Price and Locale
    		product.price
    		product.priceLocale
    		// Content size and version (hosted)
    		product.downloadContentLengths
    		product.downloadContentVersion
    	}
    }
```

You shouldn't cache the SKProduct that comes back in this point. It's really important that you get up to date product information, by performing these requests regularly. Because things like currency can fluctuate.

### In-App Purchase UI

- Up to the application
- Can have a large effect on sales
- [https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/)

**Formatting the product price**
```Swift
    let formatter = NumberFormatter()
    formatter.numberStyle = .currency
    formatter.locale = product.priceLocale // ðŸš«device locale
    let formattedString = formatter.string(from: product.price)
```
### Request Payment
```Swift
    let payment = SKPayment(product: product)
    SKPaymentQueue.default().add(payment)
```

**Provide an account identifier**

- For applications with their own account management
- Provide an opaque identifier for your user's account
    - Don't send us the user's Apple ID
    - Don't provide the actual account name
    - Don't provide the password
    - We suggest using a hash of the account name
    - 

```Swift
        let payment = SKPayment(product: product)
        payment.applicationUsername = hash(yourCustomerAccountName)
        SKPaymentQueue.defaults().add(payment)
```

StoreKit will automatically open your app and send information about the transaction to you via delegate method on the `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` protocol.

If your app isn't already installed, the App Store will download or prompt the user to buy it.

In this case, it can't be opened automatically, so instead, the user will receive a notification.

And when they tap on that, then your app will open and be sent the transaction info.
```Swift
    // Continuing a Transaction from the App Store
    // SKPayment TransationcObserver
    
    func paymentQueue(_ queue: SKPaymentQueue, shouldAddSotrePayment payment: SKPayment, 
    		forProduct product: SKProduct) -> Bool {
    	return true 
    	
    	// Hold on the payment
    	return false
    }
    
    SKPaymentQueue.default().add(savedPayment)
```

`return true` â†’ the user will be shown that nice new in-app purchase payment sheet, so it can complete transaction

`return false` â†’ If user is in the middle of onboarding, or if they're creating an accoung or if they've already unlocked the item they're trying to buy? You can holde onto the payment and return false
