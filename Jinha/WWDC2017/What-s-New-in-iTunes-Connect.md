Why customers write reviews in the first place

â†’ Sometimes customers just love our apps and they want ot let the world know

â†’ Ohter times customers may be a little confused as to why maybe you've included or not included certain features or maybe around design decisions you may have made

â†’ Finally, customers often take to reviews to let us know about bugs or crashes in our apps.

Every review only has onew response. So customer can update the review as much as they like and you can update your reponse as often as you'd like, but this is not a threaded conversation. One paring per customer.

What developer need to do to implement and make an in-app purchase a promoted?

![](/Jinha/images/What-s-New-in-iTunes-Connect.md/Untitled8.png)

The first two of which are managed in iTunes Connect, but critically you must define some promotional data for your promoted in-app purchase. â†’ image, name, description

So these are the 3 pieces of information that are surfaced and visible on the App Store, and they must be reviewed by the app review team.

Once you set up the promotional data in iTunes Connect, you need to configure your in-app purchases and you need to do things like activate it so we know to count it against your limit of 20 and you need to set a default order and visibility for your promoted in-app purchase as it would appear on the product page.

Need to implement some StoreKit APIs. Single delegate method on the `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` protocol.
