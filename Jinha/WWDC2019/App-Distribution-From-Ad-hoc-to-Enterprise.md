**Customer and  User**

They download your app from the App Store on their own device and then use it themselves.

- Ad hoc distribution lets you distribute to a limited number of devices that you choose for testing.
- App Store lets you distribute apps to the general public.

O**rganization**

They're purchasing apps on behalf of a group of users who will use those apps on either devices that organization provides to them or on their own devices.

In house and custom apps both let you distribute apps privately to organizations
